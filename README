[ABOUT]

FBP is a little mashup i made for 2 reasons:

(1) to learn some more HTML/CSS/JS/node.js/couchDB/boilerplate, instead 
    of just watching the presentations online
(2) because i'm too lazy to browse FB all day, playing a movie someone 
    posted and going back for the next song. Can't be doing that during
    office hours ;)

So please don't stalk me with feature request/deadlines/etc we're building
a house, raising an 11 months old attention-craving son and all "normal"
day activities. This a little pet-project when TV is boring and i can't 
sleep.



[TODO]

SHORT TERM

- make playlist linked list instead of shifting elements from the array
- playlist navigation
- add "previous" button
- caption avatar click == goto page
- playlist nick == see only that person's movies in the playlist
- "boss-mode" hide actual player, make SFW view
- remove doubles from playlist (& group posters ? also posted by: x, y, z)
- add share buttons (fb like/tweet/netlog/mail)

LONG TERM

- backend for storing
	- last played to determine the time interval of the playlist (newest, 
	  all, ...)
	- kick / follow users
	- append "public pages" to watchlist (eg. radioakapelle)
- vimeo integration
- soundcloud integration
- twitter integration (anyone posting music clips on it??)
- filter non-music movies
- buy a real domainname
